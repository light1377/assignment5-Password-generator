# assignment5-Password-generator
contributor: Moral Meshkot
Description: Random password generator web application.
The goal of this app is to genarate a roandom password for the uset based on their input on the length (between 10 and 64 characters), and what characters they'd like to include in h=the password.
The project has used VS code to edit the html, javascript, and css files for the webpage. Details: As mentioned in the commit messages, basic javascript tools were to be used to create the random password generator.

Challenges faced: At the beggining I was hopeless as I wrongly assumed I would have to submit my projects in chronological order and I would not be able to submit the project without catching up on my previous missing ones first, hence byt the time I realised I was too late and was rushed.
